## TrojanMap

This project focuses on using data structures in C++ and implementing various graph algorithms to build a map application.

<p align="center"><img src="img/TrojanMap.png" alt="Trojan" width="500" /></p>

- Please clone the repository, look through [README.md](README.md) and fill up functions to finish in the project.
- Please make sure that your code can run `bazel run/test`.
- In this project, you will need to fill up [trojanmap.cc](src/lib/trojanmap.cc) and add unit tests in the `tests` directory.

---

## The data Structure

Each point on the map is represented by the class **Node** shown below and defined in [trojanmap.h](src/lib/trojanmap.h).

```cpp
class Node {
  public:
    Node(){};
    Node(const Node &n){id = n.id; lat = n.lat; lon = n.lon; name = n.name; neighbors = n.neighbors; attributes = n.attributes;};
    std::string id;    // A unique id assign to each point
    double lat;        // Latitude
    double lon;        // Longitude
    std::string name;  // Name of the location. E.g. "Bank of America".
    std::vector<std::string> neighbors;  // List of the ids of all neighbor points.
    std::unordered_set<std::string> attributes;  // List of the attributes of the location.
};
```

---

## Prerequisites

### OpenCV Installation

For visualization, we use OpenCV library. You will use this library as a black box and don't need to worry about the graphic details.

Use the following commands to install OpenCV and other libarary.

### Other library Installations

For MacOS:
```shell
$ brew install cmake
$ brew install opencv
$ brew install ncurses
```

For Ubuntu:
```shell
$ cd **your project folder**
$ git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
$ sudo apt-get install cmake libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config
$ sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module
$ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
$ cp ubuntu/* ./
```

Next, type the following, but make sure that you set the **path_to_install_folder** to be the absolute path to the **install** folder under opencv.

```shell
$ cd opencv/
$ mkdir build install
$ cd build
$ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=**path_to_install_folder** -D BUILD_LIST=core,highgui,imgcodecs,imgproc,videoio ..
$ make install
```

For example, if cloned this repo under "/Users/ari/github/TrojanMap", you should type:

```shell
$ cd opencv/
$ mkdir build install
$ cd build
$ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/ari/github/TrojanMap/opencv/install -D BUILD_LIST=core,highgui,imgcodecs,imgproc,videoio ..
$ make install
```

---

## Run the program

Please run:

For MacOS,

```shell
$ bazel run src/main:main
```

For Ubuntu, you need to use the following command to prevent errors.
               
```shell
$ bazel run --cxxopt='-std=c++17' src/main:main
```

If everything is correct, this menu will show up.

```shell

Please select 1 - 8:
```

## Test the program

We created some tests for you to test your program, please run
```shell
$ bazel test tests:trojanmap_test
```

Please add you test in the [trojanmap_test_student.cc](tests/trojanmap_test_student.cc) and run

```shell
$ bazel test tests:trojanmap_test_student
```

## Step 1: Autocomplete the location name

```c++
std::vector<std::string> Autocomplete(std::string name);
```

We consider the names of nodes as the locations. Implement a method to type the partial name of the location and return a list of possible locations with partial name as prefix. Please treat uppercase and lower case as the same character.

Example:

Input: "Chi" \
Output: ["Chick-fil-A", "Chipotle", "Chinese Street Food"]

Example:

```shell
**************************************************************
* 1. Autocomplete

Chick-fil-A
Chase
Chevron 1
Chipotle
Chase Plaza Heliport
Chevron 2
Church of Christ
Chucks Chicken & Waffles
Chevron
**************************************************************
Time taken by function: 2 ms
```

## Step 2-1: Find the place's Coordinates in the Map

```c++
std::pair<double, double> GetPosition(std::string name);
```

Given a location name, return the latitude and longitude. There are no duplicated location names. You should mark the given locations on the map. If the location does not exist, return (-1, -1). The algorithm is case-sensitive.

Example:

Input: "Target" \
Output: (34.0257016, -118.2843512)

```shell
**************************************************************
* 2. Find the position                                        
**************************************************************

Please input a location:Target
*************************Results******************************
Latitude: 34.0257 Longitude: -118.284
**************************************************************
Time taken by function: 1 ms
```

<p align="center"><img src="img/Target.png" alt="Target" width="500"/></p>

## Step 2-2: Check edit distance between two location names

```c++
int CalculateEditDistance(std::string name1, std::string name2);
```

When entering a location name that does not exist in the map, the map will determine whether the input can be replaced with a "similar name" or not. Similar names refer to the names that exist in the map with a smallest distance from the original input. The distance between two names A and B is the minimum number of operations required to convert A to B. There are 3 operations:
+ Insert a character
+ Delete a character
+ Replace a character

If the exact match is found, it will be shown on the map. Otherwise, the map will show the most similar name by using FindClosestName and print a warning. For example, if I type Rolphs, I should get a warning like "Did you mean Ralphs instead of Rolphs?"

You can use dynamic programming to calculate edit distance. 

Example:

Input: "Rolphs", "Ralphs" \
Output: 1

```c++
std::string FindClosestName(std::string name);
```

Example:

Input: "Rolphs"\
Output: "Ralphs"

```shell
**************************************************************
* 2. Find the location                                        
**************************************************************

Please input a location:Rolphs
*************************Results******************************
No matched locations.
Did you mean Ralphs instead of Rolphs? [y/n]y
Latitude: 34.0318 Longitude: -118.291
**************************************************************
Time taken by function: 2 ms
```

## Step 3: CalculateShortestPath between two places

```c++
std::vector<std::string> CalculateShortestPath_Dijkstra(std::string &location1_name,
                                               std::string &location2_name);
std::vector<std::string> CalculateShortestPath_Bellman_Ford(std::string &location1_name,
                                               std::string &location2_name);
```

Given 2 locations A and B, find the best route from A to B. The distance between 2 points is the euclidean distance using latitude and longitude. You should use both Dijkstra algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm. Compare the time for the different methods. Show the routes on the map. If there is no path, please return empty vector.

Please report and compare the time spent by these 2 algorithms.

Example:

Input: "Ralphs", "Chick-fil-A" \
Output: ["2578244375","4380040154","4380040153","4380040152","4380040148","6818427920","6818427919",

## Step 4: The Travelling Trojan Problem (AKA Travelling Salesman!)

In this section, we assume that we are using a UAV which means we can fly directly from 1 point to another point. Given a vector of location ids, assume every location can reach all other locations in the vector (i.e. assume that the vector of location ids is a complete graph).
Find the shortest route that covers all the locations exactly once and goes back to the start point. 

You will need to return the progress to get the shortest route which will then be converted to an animation.  

We will use the following algorithms:

- Brute-force (i.e. generating all permutations, and returning the minimum)
```c++
std::pair<double, std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>> TravellingTrojan_Brute_force(
      std::vector<std::string> location_ids);
```
- Brute-force enhanced with early backtracking
```c++
std::pair<double, std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>> TravellingTrojan_Backtracking(
      std::vector<std::string> location_ids);
```
- [2-opt Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-opt). Also see [this paper](http://cs.indstate.edu/~zeeshan/aman.pdf)
```c++
std::pair<double, std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>> TravellingTrojan_2opt(
      std::vector<std::string> location_ids);
```

We use early backtracking when the current cost is higher than current minimum.

Please report and compare the time spent by these 3 algorithms. 2-opt algorithm may not get the optimal solution. Please show how far your solution is from the optimal solution.

Show the routes on the map. For each intermediate solution, create a new plot. Your final video presentation should include the changes to your solution.

We will randomly select N points in the map and run your program.

<p align="center"><img src="img/output.gif" alt="TSP videos" width="500"/></p>

## Step 5: Cycle Detection

```c++
bool CycleDetection(std::vector<double> &square);
```

In this section, we use a square-shaped subgraph of the original graph by using four coordinates stored in ```std::vector<double> square```, which follows the order of left, right, upper, and lower bounds. 

Then try to determine if there is a cycle path in the that subgraph. If it does, return true and report that path on the map. Otherwise return false.

Example 1:
```shell
Input: square = {-118.299, -118.264, 34.032, 34.011}
Output: true
```
Here we use the whole original graph as our subgraph. 
<p align="center"><img src="img/cycle1.png" alt="TSP" width="500"/></p>

Example 2:
```shell
Input: square = {-118.290, -118.289, 34.030, 34.020}
Output: false
```
Here we use a square area inside USC campus as our subgraph

## Step 6: Topological Sort

```c++
std::vector<std::string> DeliveringTrojan(std::vector<std::string> &location_names,
                                            std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> &dependencies);
```
In this section, we assume that we are using a UAV which means we can fly directly from 1 point to another point. Tommy Trojan got a part-time job from TrojanEats, for which he needs to pick up and deliver food from local restaurants to various location near the campus. Tommy needs to visit a few different location near the campus with certain order, since there are some constraints. For example, he must first get the food from the restaurant before arriving at the delivery point. 

The TrojanEats app will have some instructions about these constraints. So, Tommy asks you to help him figure out the feasible route!

Here we will give you a vector of location names that Tommy needs to visit, and also some dependencies between those locations.


For example, 

```shell
Input: 
location_names = {"Ralphs", "Chick-fil-A", "KFC"}
dependencies = {{"Ralphs","KFC"}, {"Ralphs","Chick-fil-A"}, {"Chick-fil-A", "KFC"}}
```

Here, ```{"Ralphs","KFC"}``` means
that Tommy must go to `Ralphs` prior to `KFC`.

Your output should be:
```shell
Output: Ralphs  -> Chick-fil-A -> KFC
```
Also, we provide ```PlotPointsOrder``` function that can visualize the results on the map. It will plot each location name and also some arrowed lines to demonstrate a feasible route.

If no feasible route exists, you could simply return an empty vector.

Hint:
- You also need to finish ```ReadLocationsFromCSVFile``` and ```ReadDependenciesFromCSVFile``` functions, so you could read and parse data from you own CSV files. We also give two sample CSV files under ```input``` folder, which could be a reference. 
- When it asks you filenames, you need to give the absolute path.
- If you do not have ```ReadLocationsFromCSVFile``` and ```ReadDependenciesFromCSVFile``` functions ready yet, you can just press enter when it asks you filenames. It will call the default locations and dependencies.
- The locations are actually nodes, and the dependencies could be directed edges. You may want to first construct a DAG and then implement topological sort algorithm to get the route.

```shell
*************************Results******************************
Topological Sorting Results:
Ralphs
Chick-fil-A
KFC
**************************************************************
Time taken by function: 2 ms
```
<p align="center"><img src="img/TopologicalSort.png" alt="TSP" width="500"/></p>

In the user interface, we read the locations and dependencies from `topologicalsort_dependencies.csv` and `topologicalsort_locations.csv` to modify your input there.

## Step 7: Find Nearby

Given a attribute name C, a location name L and a number r and k, find at most k locations in attribute C on the map near L(do not include L) with the range of r and return a vector of string ids. The order of locaitons should from
nearest to farthest. And you should not include the current location. 

```c++
std::vector<std::string> TrojanMap::FindNearby(std::string attributesName, std::string name, double r, int k);
```

## Reporting Runtime:
For each menu item, your program should show the time it took to finish each task.

Please make sure to provide various examples when you report the runtime. For example for topological sort, show an example with few nodes and another example with 10 or more nodes. The idea is to see how your runtime grows as input size grows.

## Runtime Comparison
For shortest path algorithms, you should compare solving the same problem with different algorithms (Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford). Please show the results on at least 3 different examples.

Similarly for TSP problem, please provide various examples that show the runtime comparison. In particular, you should show at what point using the exhaustive search is not practical and compare the same input with the heuristic implementation.


## Report and Rubrics:

Your final project should be checked into Github. The README of your project is your report. 

### Report:

Your REPORT.md file should include four sections:
Please create a new REPORT.md file and write your report there.
